            A&W Canada's mission is to make A&W the #1 burger choice for Baby Boomers and the fastest-growing, most successful burger business in Canada.

            Their vision focuses on quality, sustainability, and community:

            Serve high-quality food like hormone- and antibiotic-free beef and natural root beer.
            Lead in environmental responsibility with compostable packaging and waste reduction.
            Support communities through initiatives like "Burgers to Beat MS," raising over $20 million for Canadians with Multiple Sclerosis.
